# Decision-Science-App

Welcome to my GitHub. 
I am currently a graduate tutor on campus helping students in Business Statistics and Operations Management.
Both courses are from the Decision Science department. I decided to create an application that will potentially
help students better understand the topics in these two classes. Work in Progress.
